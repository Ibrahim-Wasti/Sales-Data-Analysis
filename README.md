# Sales-Data-Analysis

Project done for class, an analysis of sales for 2019 of an e-commerce company.

Merged 12 files of sales data into one dataframe using the OS and Pandas libraries.
Visualizations were created using MatPlotLib.
Answered different questions to gain insights into the data:
  - What is the best month for sales? How much was earned?
  - Which city had the highest number of sales?
  - What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
  - What products are most often sold together?
  - What product sold the most? Why?
